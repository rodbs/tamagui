<Notice>
  For custom styled() components to be optimized by the compiler, you'll need to place them in a
  node module and update your build configuration. See the [Design Systems
  guide](/docs/guides/design-systems).
</Notice>

Create a new component by extending an existing one:

```jsx
import { styled, Stack } from '@tamagui/core'

export const Circle = styled(Stack, {
  borderRadius: 100_000_000,
})
```

Usage:

```jsx
<Circle x={10} y={10} backgroundColor="red" />
```

Note, `tamagui` and `@tamagui/core` both export many of the same helpers, like styled. If you are using `tamagui`, you don't need to ever add `@tamagui/core` to your package.json or import it and can instead import directly from `tamagui` itself.

The `styled` function only accepts Tamagui components or components that accept the `className` property, for now. There is a workaround option to support react-native-web components, but it's not a public API as it will likely change with their next release.

You can pass any prop that is supported by the component you are extending, even variants of the parent component. Tamagui will figure out the style props up-front, turn them into classNames, and then pass the non-style props down to the component as defaultProps.

## Variants

Let's add some variants:

```jsx
import { styled, Stack } from '@tamagui/core'

export const Circle = styled(Stack, {
  borderRadius: 100_000_000,

  variants: {
    pin: {
      top: {
        position: 'absolute',
        top: 0,
      },
    },

    centered: {
      true: {
        alignItems: 'center',
        justifyContent: 'center',
      },
    },

    size: {
      '...size': (size, { tokens }) => {
        return {
          width: tokens.size[size] ?? size,
          height: tokens.size[size] ?? size,
        }
      },
    },
  },
})

```

We can use these like so:

```jsx
<Circle pin="top" centered size="$lg" />
```

We're showing off a few different styles of variants here. We'll expand on them below:

### Boolean Variants

The special key `true` will map to a boolean property. So the `centered` prop will be typed to accept true or false, and when true it will apply it's styles.

### Spread Variants

When you write variants, you have to be explicit so Typescript and the runtime know exactly which props you accept. This can be especially cumbersome when you want to "gather" all the values of a specific token. For example, without spread variants, if you wanted to have a `pad` property that accepted all the keys from `tokens.size`, you'd have to write this:

```jsx
// in your tamagui.config.ts:
const tokens = createTokens({
  size: {
    sm: 10,
    md: 15,
    lg: 25,
    // ...
  }
})

export default createTamagui({
  tokens
})

// somewhere in your app:
const MyButton = styled(Stack, {
  variants: {
    pad: {
      sm: {
        padding: tokens.size.sm,
      },
      md: {
        padding: tokens.size.md,
      },
      lg: {
        padding: tokens.size.lg,
      },
      // ...
    }
  }
})

// now you can
<MyButton pad="$lg" />
```

This is verbose, and only gets more verbose if you add more sizes. It would require always updating every component every time you change the tokens.

Spread variants solve this problem. Instead, we can write:

```jsx
// in your tamagui.config.ts:
const tokens = createTokens({
  size: {
    sm: 10,
    md: 15,
    lg: 25,
    // ...
  }
})

export default createTamagui({
  tokens
})

// somewhere in your app:
const MyButton = styled(Stack, {
  variants: {
    pad: {
      '...size': (val, { tokens }) => ({
        padding: tokens.size[val]
      }),
    }
  }
})

// now you can
<MyButton pad="$lg" />
```

Spread variants save you from having to define hardcoded styles for every key (`sm`, `md`, `lg`) in your token object. They collect values from any of your top level token categories. So you can only use `...color`, `...size`, `...space`, `...font`, `...fontSize`, `...lineHeight`, `...radius`, `...letterSpace`, or `...zIndex`. They must be prefixed with `...` as that is how they are typed properly and assembled for runtime.

The Spread variant function will receive two arguments: the first is the value given to the property (`"$lg"`), and the second is an object with `{ theme, tokens, props }`.

- `theme` a proxy to your theme that lets you access all theme values using normal keys, or with a `$` prefix.
- `tokens` of type TokensParsed, the tokens from `createTokens`, but the keys all start with `$`.

Because you can expand them to any number of styles, they can save a ton of code:

```jsx
const MyButton = styled(Stack, {
  variants: {
    square: {
      '...size': (size, { tokens }) => {
        // size === '$lg'
        // tokens.size.$lg === 25
        return {
          width: tokens.size[size] ?? size,
          height: tokens.size[size] ?? size,
        }
      },
    },
  }
})
```
