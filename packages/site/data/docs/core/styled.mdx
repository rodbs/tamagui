description: Extend and build custom and optimizable components.

<Notice>
  For custom styled() components to be optimized by the compiler, you'll need to place them in a
  node module and update your build configuration. See the [Design Systems
  guide](/docs/guides/design-systems).
</Notice>

Create a new component by extending an existing one:

```jsx
import { styled, Stack } from '@tamagui/core'

export const Circle = styled(Stack, {
  borderRadius: 100_000_000,
})
```

Usage:

```jsx
<Circle x={10} y={10} backgroundColor="red" />
```

Note, `tamagui` and `@tamagui/core` both export many of the same helpers, like styled. If you are using `tamagui`, you don't need to ever add `@tamagui/core` to your package.json or import it and can instead import directly from `tamagui` itself.

The `styled` function only accepts Tamagui components or components that accept the `className` property, for now. There is a workaround option to support react-native-web components, but it's not a public API as it will likely change with their next release.

You can pass any prop that is supported by the component you are extending, even variants of the parent component. Tamagui will figure out the style props up-front, turn them into classNames, and then pass the non-style props down to the component as defaultProps.

## Variants

Let's add some variants:

```jsx
import { styled, Stack } from '@tamagui/core'

export const Circle = styled(Stack, {
  borderRadius: 100_000_000,

  variants: {
    pin: {
      top: {
        position: 'absolute',
        top: 0,
      },
    },

    centered: {
      true: {
        alignItems: 'center',
        justifyContent: 'center',
      },
    },

    size: {
      '...size': (size, { tokens }) => {
        return {
          width: tokens.size[size] ?? size,
          height: tokens.size[size] ?? size,
        }
      },
    },
  },
})

```

We can use these like so:

```jsx
<Circle pin="top" centered size="$lg" />
```

To learn more about to use them and all the special types, [see the docs on variants](/docs/core/variants).
