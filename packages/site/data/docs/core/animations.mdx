Add animations to Tamagui with an animation driver.

Animation drivers are designed to be swappable, so you can use lightweight CSS animations or other web-focused animation libraries on the web, while using larger but more advanced libraries like `reanimated` on native - all without having to change a line outside of configuration.

## Installation

### CSS

The `@tamagui/animations-css` package works with the tamagui compiler and runtime to give you simple ways to share typed animations across all your components.

To install it add to your package.json:

```bash
yarn add @tamagui/animations-css
```

Then add it to your [config](/docs/intro/configuration):

```tsx
import { createTamagui } from 'tamagui'
import { createAnimations } from '@tamagui/animations-css'

export default createTamagui({
  animations: createAnimations({
    easeInFast: 'ease-in 150ms',
    easeInMedium: 'ease-in 300ms',
    easeInSlow: 'ease-in 450ms',
  })
  // ...
})
```

At runtime, the plugin does very little except to set the `transition` property in CSS. At compile-time, the compiler do the same, ensuring you get all the benefits of prop removal and view flattening even when using animations.

### Reanimated

[Reanimated](https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-reanimated/) is an animation library that targets React Native and React Native Web. It runs off-thread animations, and provides nicer syntax and hooks. It weighs over 100Kb minified though, which makes it not always useful for the web.

To install it add to your package.json:

```bash
yarn add @tamagui/animations-reanimated
```

Then add it to your [config](/docs/intro/configuration):

```tsx
import { createTamagui } from 'tamagui'
import { createAnimations } from '@tamagui/animations-reanimated'

export default createTamagui({
  animations: createAnimations({
    easeInFast: {
      type: 'spring',
      damping: 20,
      mass: 1.2,
      stiffness: 250,
    },
    easeInMedium: {
      type: 'spring',
      damping: 10,
      mass: 0.9,
      stiffness: 100,
    },
    easeInSlow: {
      type: 'spring',
      damping: 20,
      stiffness: 60,
    },
  })
  // ...
})
```

At runtime, this plugin parses animatable style properties and hands them over to reanimated off-thread, using worklets. It doesn't do anything at compile time - reanimated must run via JS.

Note the keys match between CSS and reanimated, so you can swap them out.

<Notice>
  **Save bundle size** by removing `Animated` and `AnimatedFlatList` from react-native-web. On
  Next.js, use the [excludeReactNativeWebExports` option](/docs/intro/installation#next.js) config
  option.
</Notice>

## Usage

The `animation` prop will now have `springy` as a valid value. By default, animations will apply to all animatable styles. This is a lot like setting `all` in a CSS animation.

Let's adding some hover styles to see them animate:

```tsx

```

We can limit the properties animations apply to with the `animated` prop:

```tsx

```

Here's a working demo:

<HeroContainer smaller>
  <AnimationsHoverDemo />
</HeroContainer>

```jsx collapsible template=AnimationsHover

```

### enterStyle

Setting `enterStyle` styles on any component tell it to start with those styles, and immediately transition into their regular styles:

<HeroContainer smaller>
  <AnimationsEnterDemo />
</HeroContainer>

```jsx collapsible template=AnimationsEnter

```

### AnimatePresence and exitStyle

AnimatePresence animates direct children before they unmount. It's inspired by and forked from [Framer Motion](https://github.com/framer/motion), but works with any animation in Tamagui.

To use with `@tamagui/core`, install and import `@tamagui/animate-presence`. It's already bundled and exported from `tamagui`.

```tsx
import { Square, AnimatePresence } from 'tamagui'

export const MyComponent = ({ isVisible }) => (
  <AnimatePresence>
    {isVisible && (
      <Square
        key="my-square"
        animation="bounce"
        backgroundColor="green"
        size={50}
        exitStyle={{
          size: 100,
        }}
      />
    )}
  </AnimatePresence>
)
```

Wrap one or more tamagui components with AnimatePresence. This enables the use the exitStyle prop, whichÂ accepts all style properties and variants, which will be animated to using the `animation` defined before the component is unmounted.

<Notice>
  Animated child components must each have a unique key prop so AnimatePresence can track their
  presence in the tree.
