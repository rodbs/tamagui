By default, Tamagui ships without animations. Now in beta, you can plug-in whichever animation driver you'd like, or write your own.

Animation drivers are designed to be swappable, so you can use lightweight CSS animations or other web-focused animation libraries on the web, while using more advanced libraries like `reanimated` on native - all without changing any of your view code.

## Installing an animation driver

To your `tamagui.config.ts` file add:

```tsx
import { animations } from './animations'

export default createTamagui({
  animations,
  ...theRestOfYourConfig,
})
```

Now, in your `animations.ts` file:

```tsx
import { createAnimations } from '@tamagui/animations-css'

export const animations = createAnimations({
  springy: 'ease-in-out 300ms',
})
```

If you want reanimated on native, add a `animations.native.ts` file:

```tsx
import { createAnimations } from '@tamagui/animations-reanimated'

export const animations = createAnimations({
  springy: {
    type: 'spring',
    damping: 20,
    stiffness: 90,
  },
})
```

Note the keys match, so you can swap them out.
