By default, Tamagui ships without animations. Now in beta, you can plug-in whichever animation driver you'd like, or write your own.

Animation drivers are designed to be swappable, so you can use lightweight CSS animations or other web-focused animation libraries on the web, while using more advanced libraries like `reanimated` on native - all without changing any of your view code.

## Installing an animation driver

To your `tamagui.config.ts` file add:

```tsx
import { animations } from './animations'

export default createTamagui({
  animations,
  ...theRestOfYourConfig,
})
```

Now, in your `animations.ts` file:

```tsx
import { createAnimations } from '@tamagui/animations-css'

export const animations = createAnimations({
  springy: 'ease-in-out 300ms',
})
```

If you want reanimated on native, add a `animations.native.ts` file:

```tsx
import { createAnimations } from '@tamagui/animations-reanimated'

export const animations = createAnimations({
  springy: {
    type: 'spring',
    damping: 20,
    stiffness: 90,
  },
})
```

Note the keys match, so you can swap them out.

## Using animations

The `animation` prop will now have `springy` as a valid value. By default, animations will apply to all animatable styles. This is a lot like setting `all` in a CSS animation.

Let's addding some hover styles to see them animate:

```tsx

```

We can limit the properties animations apply to with the `animated` prop:

```tsx

```

### CSS

The `@tamagui/animations-css` package works with the tamagui compiler and runtime to give you simple ways to share typed animations across all your components.

To install it add to your package.json:

```bash
yarn add @tamagui/animations-css
```

Then add it to your [config](/docs/intro/configuration):

```tsx
import { createTamagui } from 'tamagui'
import { createAnimations } from '@tamagui/animations-css'

export default createTamagui({
  animations: createAnimations({
    easeInFast: 'ease-in 150ms',
    easeInMedium: 'ease-in 300ms',
    easeInSlow: 'ease-in 450ms',
  })
  // ...
})
```

At runtime, the plugin does very little except to set the `transition` property in CSS. At compile-time, the compiler do the same, ensuring you get all the benefits of prop removal and view flattening even when using animations.

### Reanimated

[Reanimated](https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-reanimated/) is an animation library that targets React Native, as well as React Native Web. It's claim to fame is running off-thread animations, providing a nicer syntax than React Native Animated, as well as a variety helpful hooks, helper functions, and other libraries that play along nicely. It does add more to your bundle size though, and some animations still wont run as well as CSS on the web. That's why Tamagui [allows using different drivers depending on the platform](#installing-an-animation-driver).

The `@tamagui/animations-reanimated` package works with the tamagui compiler and runtime to give you simple ways to share typed animations across all your components.

To install it add to your package.json:

```bash
yarn add @tamagui/animations-reanimated
```

Then add it to your [config](/docs/intro/configuration):

```tsx
import { createTamagui } from 'tamagui'
import { createAnimations } from '@tamagui/animations-reanimated'

export default createTamagui({
  animations: createAnimations({
    easeInFast: {
      type: 'spring',
      damping: 20,
      mass: 1.2,
      stiffness: 250,
    },
    easeInMedium: {
      type: 'spring',
      damping: 10,
      mass: 0.9,
      stiffness: 100,
    },
    easeInSlow: {
      type: 'spring',
      damping: 20,
      stiffness: 60,
    },
  })
  // ...
})
```

At runtime, this plugin parses animatable style properties and hands them over to reanimated off-thread, using worklets. It doesn't do anything at compile time as reanimated must run via JS.
