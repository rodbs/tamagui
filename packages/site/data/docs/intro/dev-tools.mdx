Tamagui has two ways of giving you a lot more insight into what's happening.

## Debug pragma

Adding `// debug` to the top of any file will output a verbose stream of everything Tamagui is doing at compile-time.

Use it to see what's being extracted, why, and every step along the optimization pipeline.

## Debug prop

Adding `debug` to any Tamagui component will output a lot of information on what's going on at runtime. Use it like so:

```tsx
import { Button } from 'tamagui'

export default () => <Button debug>Hello world</Button>
```

And you'll see props, styles, and a variety of variables relevant to processing them.

## Global Tamagui

In development mode, there's a global `Tamagui` with a lot of helpful internals, including your entire parsed config from `tamagui.config.ts`.

Beyond your config, you have:

- **insertedCSS**: All the selectors inserted by Tamagui (before runtime).

## Inspecting Components

Any `styled()` component will have a `staticConfig` property attached to it:

```tsx
const Circle = styled(Stack, {
  borderRadius: 1000
})

console.log(Circle.staticConfig) // lots of helpful information
```

- `componentName` is taken from the `name` key
- `variants` contains the merged variants including parents.
- `defaultProps` is the extracted props left to use as defaults on the component.
