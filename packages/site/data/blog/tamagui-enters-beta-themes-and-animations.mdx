<IntroParagraph>Tamagui is now in beta üéâ</IntroParagraph>

<IntroParagraph>
  What is Tamagui? It's a suite of libraries for making cross platform app interfaces with React and
  React Native, the main parts being **three things**:
</IntroParagraph>

<IntroParagraph>
  <UL>
    <LI>A style library for creating React Native + Web components.</LI>
    <LI>An optimizing compiler on top, for big performance gains.</LI>
    <LI>
      A suite of <span className="rainbow clip-text">universal</span> components.
    </LI>
  </UL>
</IntroParagraph>

Since the first alpha it's been six months, several hundred of bugfixes, three demo apps, and several huge new features. Plus, a totally [refreshed site](/), and a [benchmark suite](/docs/intro/benchmarks).

Lets take a look at the changes in the beta:

## Start faster

Introducing **create-tamagui-app**, to get started much faster with Expo, Next.js, and Tamagui:

```bash
npx create-tamagui-app@latest my-app
```

You can even clone + deploy it instantly with Vercel and Github:

A big shout out to [Fernando Rojo](https://twitter.com/fernandotherojo) for creating [Solito](https://solito.dev), a great library for sharing all your views between Expo and Next.js, and the bootstrap repo we borrowed from.

## Themes üé®

Themes have been completely redone and I'm really excited about them, they are a big step forward and I haven't seen any system really give the power and flexibility Tamagui has now.

### Sub-themes

Tamagui already supported sub-themes, with various edge cases. With the rewrite, sub-themes now work much better, and the `theme` prop is available on every component, including ones you create using the `styled` factory function.

<ScrollView horizontal showsHorizontalScrollbars={false}>
  <XStack py="$4">
    <YStack scale={0.8}>
      <MediaPlayerDemo theme="pink" />
    </YStack>
    <YStack scale={0.8}>
      <MediaPlayerDemo theme="blue" />
    </YStack>
  </XStack>
</ScrollView>

### Component themes

Not only that, but you can give any `styled` component a `name` and it ensure that sub-theme applies. Theme props are now normalized to match React Native style properties as well.

### Tons of small improvements

We've also fixed and improved a lot of how the `@tamagui/feather-icons`, the `Button` component, and the theme engine all work together to automatically handle passing values between each other.

### Why it matters

I'm really happy with how this landed. The focus could have been on components, but while working on Tooltip/Popover/Drawer, it became clear how important is is to get the fundamentals right first. **Animations and themes both have an oversized influence on everything above them**.

In general, UI kits are hard because they are like balancing stones; each layer has a huge influence on the next. The interfaces are especially hard, and once they're locked in they're harder to change.

<XStack
  mt="$4"
  mb="$6"
  height={200}
  maxWidth={500}
  ov="hidden"
  ai="center"
  jc="center"
  px="$5"
  als="center"

  <Image

    width={520 * 0.5}
    height={402 * 0.5}
  />
</XStack>

This release lays much better foundational stones in themes and animations.

[Read the docs for much more on themes](/docs/intro/themes).

## Animations

Animations are making their way, experimentally, into `@tamagui/core`. They are unstable, but we want to get feedback and use them more in practice.

<OffsetBox size="hero">
  <XStack py="$4">
    <ExampleAnimations />
  </XStack>
</OffsetBox>

They're implemented as pluggable drivers, starting with two:

- [CSS](/docs/core/animations#css)
- [Reanimated](/docs/core/animations#css)

Which means you can swap entire animation drivers depending on your platform. Want lighter bundles on web, but spring animations on native? Use both packages, and swap them out based on your environment.

[Read the docs on animations](/docs/core/animations) to get started.

## New Components

Over the last few months we've added:

- [Inputs](/docs/components/forms)
- [Image](/docs/components/image)
- [Separator](/docs/components/separator)
- [ThemeInverse](/docs/core/theme#theme-inverse) and [ThemeReset](/docs/core/theme#theme-reset)
- [Popover](/docs/components/popover) and [HoverablePopover](/docs/components/hoverable-popover)
- [Tooltip](/docs/components/tooltip)
- [Drawer](/docs/components/drawer)
- [Square and Circle](/docs/components/shapes)
- [HTML Elements](/docs/components/html-elements)

And we're just getting started!

There's tons of room to grow and improve. We're looking at using [Floating UI](https://floating-ui.com/) to improve our floating panels, and getting essential form elements in next.

## Focus styling

We landed experimental support for the `focusStyle` prop, which works much like `pressStyle` and `hoverStyle`.

## ThemeReset

Sometimes you want to have your theme reset to the one above it. ThemeReset does just this. Note: it's not SSR compatible if you're doing automatic light/dark themes - it will still work, but there may be a flash on first load. There's a fix for this that is a bit involved,so we think it's still useful to release as experimental until we land that.

## Renaming space to gap

As we're moving from alpha to beta, we're going to take this chance to make breaking changes. To better align with the flexbox spec, `space` has been renamed to `gap`.

## A pre-made base theme

Use the themes from the Tamagui site itself without any setup at all, simply install `@tamagui/theme-base` and add `themes` and `tokens` to `createTamagui()` in your `tamagui.config.ts`.

## And much more...

- üêõ Hundreds of bug-fixes.
- ‚ú® Six new pages added to docs, and every docs page has been improved.
- ‚ú® Smarter styled() function - now automatically detects Text/View components and properly handles their styling/types. It also detects Inputs and a wider range of react-native components for automatic styling.
- ‚ú® `@tamagui/shorthands` - use our default shorthands

## Acknowledgements

This release once again is inspired by or forks code from a variety of other libraries and developers.

I'd like to thank:

- [Fenando Rojo](https://twitter.com/fernandotherojo) and [Moti](https://moti.fyi) for the elegant reanimated animation driver that served as the starting point of `@tamagui/animations-reanimated`.
- [Matt Perry](https://twitter.com/mattgperry) and [Framer Motion](https://github.com/framer/motion) for the base of AnimatePresence in `@tamagui/animate-presence`.
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com) for the inspiration of using a nice resizable browser to demo responsive design.
