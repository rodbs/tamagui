Tamagui enters beta!

Six months, hundreds of bugs, 3 demo apps, 1 benchmark suite, and 2 big new features: **themes v2** and **pluggable animations**. Here's what's new:

## Start faster with create-tamagui-app

Set up a starter repo with expo, webpack, and tamagui configured and ready to go:

```bash
npx create-tamagui-app@latest my-app
```

## Themes v2

Themes has been redone to add a ton of flexiblity and power. Tamagui now supports unlimited sub-themes, and per-component theming. Further, we've standardized the names of theme props, giving full control to customize any aspect of every component.

<ScrollView horizontal showsHorizontalScrollbars={false}>
  <XStack>
    <MediaPlayerDemo theme="pink" />
    <MediaPlayerDemo theme="blue" />
    <MediaPlayerDemo theme="yellow" />
  </XStack>
</ScrollView>

We've also fixed and improved a lot of how the `@tamagui/feather-icons`, the `Button` component, and the theme engine all work together to automatically handle passing values between each other.

[Read the docs for more on how](/docs/intro/themes).

## Animations

Animations are making their way into `@tamagui/core`. While they should be considered somewhat experimental as we get feedback and use them more in practice, we think the API's won't change signifcantly.

## New Components

Over the last few months we've added the [Inputs](/docs/components/forms), [Image](/docs/components/image), [Separator](/docs/components/separator), [ThemeInverse](/docs/core/theme#theme-inverse), [Popover](/docs/components/popover), [HoverablePopover](/docs/components/hoverable-popover), [Tooltip](/docs/components/tooltip), [Drawer](/docs/components/drawer), [Square and Circle](/docs/components/shapes), and [HTML Element](/docs/components/html-elements) components.

These are big, helpful components and we've made sure each works fully with the optimizing compiler and full suite of react-native and Tamagui properties.

But this is also just the start.
