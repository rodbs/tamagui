Tamagui enters beta!

Six months, hundreds of bugs, 3 demo apps, 1 benchmark suite, and 2 big new features: **themes v2** and **pluggable animations**. Here's what's new:

## Start faster with create-tamagui-app

Set up a starter repo with expo, webpack, and tamagui configured and ready to go:

```bash
npx create-tamagui-app@latest my-app
```

## Themes v2

Themes has been redone to add a ton of flexiblity and power. Tamagui now supports unlimited sub-themes, and per-component theming. Further, we've standardized the names of theme props, giving full control to customize any aspect of every component.

<ScrollView horizontal showsHorizontalScrollbars={false}>
  <XStack>
    <MediaPlayerDemo theme="pink" />
    <MediaPlayerDemo theme="blue" />
    <MediaPlayerDemo theme="yellow" />
  </XStack>
</ScrollView>

We've also fixed and improved a lot of how the `@tamagui/feather-icons` and Button component together with themes to automatically handle passing values between each other.

[Read the docs for more on how](/docs/intro/themes).
